0,"Went here for my first meal in Toronto and it did not disappoint. I got a veggie combo- it came with palak paneer, aloo gobi, plain naan, rice, onion pakora, daal, and rice pudding. Such a great deal for a low cost, and it easily was enough food to split into 2-3 meals.",2021-11-28,5.0,Pittsburgh,0,0,0
1,"For the life of me I really don't understand why Banjara is as highly rated as it is.The food is BLAND. even medium spice level is more mild than any other Indian food restaurant I've ever been to. The entrees have almost no sauce, it's just meat and/or veg and a tiny amount of sauce. Want a potato curry? Ok here is a bunch of large hard pieces of potato in a tiny amount of sauce. I hadn't had Banjara in a few years and ordered some last night and it's basically the most disappointing Indian food I've had in years. So bland, so boring, not savoury, not rich in flavour, and expensive also! Never again. Only giving 2 stars because at leas the veg pakoras were good.",2021-09-27,2.0,Toronto,0,0,0
2,I love Banjara! It's impressive how well they cater the flavours at all spice levels and can please both the traditional Indian customers and non Indian palette alike! All items I have tried are great. The butter chicken and karahi lamb were delicious! This is a Toronto staple and most likely the best Indian restaurant around.,2021-11-07,4.0,Waterloo,0,0,0

4,"Haven't been able to give Yelp enough lovin with everything going on so I think this review is long overdue.Amazing Indian food on the cusp of Korea town. I have come here again and again, and will keep coming back again and again. I've already made plans with friends to visit together once things are better and can't wait! I enjoy variety so I always get the combo platters. All their combo platters come with your choice of main (meat/veggie) along with rice, naan, daal curry, aloo gobi, veggie pakora and ricepudding. For real, you get all this! My go to is the butter chicken but the lamb vidaloo is also pretty awesome. You can also modify the spice level of your dishes. Other than the great food, I've always received friendly service too. A bonus to drivers who know how difficult it is to find parking downtown: psssst there's free parking here. Banjara, you keep doing you. Heartheart",2020-07-12,5.0,North York,5,1,3

8,"Its not often I order take-out Indian but from now on, when  I do it will Banjara!We opted to change our tastes this weekend by grabbing some good old curry and naan. Banjara was close by and the 5pm hunger pangs meant most places would be less busy.I ordered a whole tandoori chicken, Kahari chicken, naan, and rice. The order was quick and when  I got home, I was pleasantly surprised to find a side of chutney, papadums, and a small rice dessert in addition to my order, well done guys!!The packaging was awesome, no leaks, food was hot and damn fine in flavour!Portions were huge and well worth the $40 bucks!!Can't believe I waited so long to give them another try, I will be back!!",2019-09-03,5.0,Vaughan,1,1,1
9,"I was craving some good butter chicken, and found Banjara on one of BlogTO's top lists for indian food and was praised particularly for its butter chicken, so I had to give it a try. I must say, this was truly phenomenal butter chicken. I ordered the dinner combo which came with various sides like rice, naan, daal, aloo gobi, vegetable pakoras, and rice pudding. Each curry had a unique and in tense blend of deep, pungent and highly developed layers of flavour, and the butter chicken especially was incredible - tender, spicy and rich, and just bursting with a myriad of flavours. The pakoras were crisp and beautifully seasoned, the naan was lightly buttered and salted, perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside, and paired perfectly with the curries. Lastly, the rice pudding was a delightfully refreshing end to the meal. Banjara's placement in BlogTO's top list is well deserved and I will definitely be returning whenever I want good Indian food in Toronto.",2019-08-12,5.0,Waterloo,2,0,0

After 3 hours (930pm) I called again and got spun some story about how the driver got lost. I'd prefer if they just told me it wasn't going to come so I could order something else instead.

12,"There isn't much question when it comes to Indian food in Toronto - most locals will tell you that Banjara is the best. Located practically in Christie Pits Park, this Bloorcourt Village restaurant has been around since 2003 with Chef Raj Veerella at the helm. They've even expanded into two locations. It was a done deal for me when I saw that NOW Toronto voted them #1 Best Indian Restaurant 2018, and of course that blogTO has them listed as the #1 Best Butter Chicken and #1 Best Indian Restaurant in Toronto. I was very excited to experience it all for myself and visited on a Saturday evening. They don't take reservations for parties smaller than five people but due to the restaurant's specious dining areas they often have plenty of room to seat everyone. I also appreciated the fact that they have their own dedicated parking lot, something very rare for restaurants located in the core areas of the city.As previously mentioned, the space is quite large and you will immediately be met with a buzzing restaurant and tantalizing aromas upon entry. There are several dining rooms, including an enclosed patio area that allows for a lot of beautiful natural light. The overall decor is fairly modest but you will find colourful sari-style curtains and brightly painted walls. The room is full of busy servers moving plates back and forth. I was happy to be seated in the patio area, right next to the window.The menu is very long and involves many different categories. I would almost advise to look at the menu online in advance so that you can arrive prepared! We were immediately delivered a basket of Papadum along with two sauces; a sweet tamarind chutney and a green chutney made with mint and cilantro. Papadum is a type of thin cracker. Light and crispy, this one was delightful to munch on as we waited for our order to arrive.The next thing that I always take care of right away in Indian restaurants is ordering a Masala Chai (Indian milk black tea infused with ginger and cardamom - $3.99), quite possibly my favourite beverage of all-time. Or at least one of them. There is nothing quite like a proper Indian restaurant chai. It's not at all like what you get in coffee shops. This one was exactly the way that I like it, not too sweet and full of warm spice. Chai often gets served with sugar on the side but I never use it. I find that the perfect blend of spices is usually great just the way that it is.There is also a rose lassi on the menu that I absolutely want to try next time!!Back to the food menu, you'll find sections for; appetizers, soups & salads, tandoori sizzlers, chicken, meat delights, seafood delights, vegetarian dishes, rice dishes, breads, side orders, and desserts. Like I said, there's a lot. We decided to begin with a starter and zeroed in on the list of pakoras. With six types available, it had to be the Fish Pakoras (Rolled in chickpea batter and deep fried - $7.99 for six). We had ordered these from the starters section in hopes of having them as an appetizer, IE: before the rest of our food. However, these arrived after the rest of our food. This kinda defeats the purpose of a ""starter,"" doesn't it? Regardless, they were enjoyable and I found them to be unique among all other fish pakoras that I have had in the past. I'm accustomed to my fish pakoras being mostly akin to a fishstick, with a pretty indiscernible ""fish item"" on the inside. This is not the case at Banjara. The fish inside of these pakoras was REAL. I could clearly see that it was a large, juicy piece of pink fish (possibly trout) with the skin still on. I appreciated this a lot! Pakoras always taste amazing dipped in tamarind chutney and these golden-brown, perfectly fried and crispy fish babies were no different.Our food came out extremely quickly upon ordering it (apart from the pakoras, which took longer). Our friendly server recorded our order efficiently and a parade of various servers delivered our array of bowls and plates soon after. Of course we ordered the Butter Chicken (Banjara's most famous dish - chicken tikka (white meat) cooked in the tandoor, then simmered in a creamy tomato gravy - $15.99) given its reputation of being the best in the city. I loved this. The hype is real. The pieces of chicken were large and juicy. The sauce was a gorgeous velvety bath of richness. There was a slight smokey flavour to the dish that really made it deliciously unique. A delicate mix of spices played in the smoke. Up until this point the best curry dishes that I'd ever tasted were from Lahore Karahi in London, England. This butter chicken totally compares and is worth visiting Banjara for. I will be dreaming about it.Next, from the Vegetarian Dishes section, we ordered the Navratan Korma (Potato, baby corn, paneer, peas, beans, carrot, broccoli, cauliflower & mushrooms in a creamy cashew gravy - $12.99), another favourite dish of ours. Otherwise known as ""vegetable korma,"" the word navratan refers to the nine key ingredients th",2020-01-30,5.0,Edmonton,2,0,0
13,"The food is good especially the butter chicken. However, the reason why I gave it a 3 star rating is the service and the quality check. First of all, I noticed all the customers getting the complimentary Papadum but we never got it. :( Second is I ordered the combo (I cannot remember the actual name of it). It included the main, I chose butter chicken, rice, veggies, rice pudding, pakoras and naan bread. When I got the dish the pakoras were missing. That is a ""no no"" to serve a plate to the customer with something missing and not acknowledge it. 2 eyes must of had to look at the plate before it came to me (The chef, the person at the pass and the server). Thank goodness for yelp pictures. Having an empty section looked too weird so I had to flag a server to show them a missing food item from the yelp picture. They eventually brought a bowl of them to me. However this should have been spotted even before I got the plate.My husband ordered the Beef Vindaloo. He said it was good but not the best he had in the city. Together we also ordered Paneer and thought it was ok. I guess we have been to many other Indian restaurants and had better.",2019-04-08,3.0,Calgary,1,1,0
14,"This was my first visit to Banjara Indian Cuisjne.Parking was tricky as they have an interesting parking lot.  I got a spot.The service is friendly and fast.  The restaurant is clean.They were able to serve me food that I could eat which can be tricky as I have to eat gluten free.  It was also very fast.The menu had several choice with multiple choices of meat.  There were also several vegetable choices.I ordered the okra, and the lamb roganjosh.The lamb roganjosh was unlike anything I have had elsewhere.  Very generous in the portions, and large amounts of meat in it.  It was served very different from what I have had elsewhere.I found thought it was full of lots of great ingredients including lots of fresh peppers and onions, it was lacking something.  It also looked like cat food.  The presentation of the dish could use a little tweaking.The okra was okay, but it was full of leaves that were hard to chew and stuck to my mouth. I ended up picking out the leaves.  It had a very generous amount of ginger, which I really like, but the okra also needed something.  It was a little bland.I will try this restaurant again on a different day and see if there is a difference.  I've seen this restaurant get some good reviews, so I am assuming that the meal I had today is not typical of their normal food.",2018-01-27,3.0,Newmarket,0,0,0
15,"It's about time I reviewed this place because it's been the only Indian restaurant near Downtown that I've been coming to consistently in the past 3.5 years. The taste of their food can't be beat if you're looking for Indian food downtown! I often order the malai kofta, which is served at varying spice levels depending on your order. It's the perfect creamy texture, and the kofta balls are soft and tasty (no raisins). The serving sizes are very generous and all their curries can be shared. When I order a takeout curry, I can often eat it for 2-3 meals with rice! The prices are very fair, curries are no more than $13 generally, making this my go to spot as a student when I'm craving Indian food. The service here can vary, but I go here for the food rather than the service. My only complaint would be that their naan isn't as good as other places. The garlic naan is coated with a strange garlic powder, and the other naans are just adequate.",2018-01-16,4.0,Cupertino,0,0,0
16,The best authentic Indian food in downtown. They know they difference between tandoor and oven baked. Very few places use actual tandoor grilled stuff.

18,"A friend highly recommended this place and was excited to try it in person. The service was friendly and efficient but also knew when to leave you alone which is a nice balance. I was seated promptly in the glass atrium the moment I walked in, given a papadum as a appetizer to munch on and informed that there was a button underneath the table for whenever I was ready to order. I appreciated being able to wait for the rest of the dinning party comfortably without any pressure.The lunch or dinner quick combo platters are great because you get to try the Daal curry, Aloogobi, Veggie Pakora and a dish of your choice. It also comes with rice, naan and a bit of rice pudding to end the meal with. I got the Malai Kofta, which were soft moist paneer and potato dumplings in a tomato cream gravy. The assortment of dishes that came with the combo was great, nothing was too spicy but each carried a unique flavor. The butter naan was the perfect medium to pick up all the different choices in front of me. Halfway through the meal, the table next to us got a dish of okra, so I already know what I'm ordering the next time I'm here!",2016-09-28,4.0,Toronto,1,1,0

The waitress was very pleasant and constantly came to fill our glasses with water.We ordered a mixed grill of items to start so that we were able to sample bite size amounts of different foods. We had veggie Pokora which was mixed vegtables in a batter. It was hard to tell what I was eating.  It all tasted the same. We had the Chicken Vindaloo..... do not order the hot.  I broke out in a sweat, my tongue was on fire. Although my husband enjoyed it. I quite enjoyed the Mango Lassi drink. A must to order for next time .  I watched the food served to all the tables and it seemed people ordered individual combination platters.   Note for next time.Parking is limited so we had to find a spot on the street.  Besure to get your parking ticket.

21,"No one eats more than I do. Seriously.I am a fat, fat man, in a little man's body. All I do is eat, then walk to the next restaurant to burn off a couple calories to eat again. I've eaten all over this great city but only started writing reviews now because the Ball & Chain's sister got invited to Yelp Elite and she can't even boil water and only eats where I tell her, so here we go:Constantly burning down, but keeps on ticking. That's the sign of a good restaurant. #resilient.They deliver for free if you spend over $30, so I usually order a ton of stuff and have leftovers for days. Their menu is daunting and can be confusing because they split out curry dishes that my Indian friends would assume are the same thing, but I've never had a bad item, just some items are better than others. Tried a shrimp dish recently and though I didn't get a ton of shrimp, they served big juicy shrimp, cooked perfectly. Nothing like those midget shrimp in shrimp fried rice...still not convinced they're actually shrimp.I generally prefer my Indian food buffets because their dishes lend very well to it, and I get to try the entire gamut without running up a massive bill, but this is my fav indian a la carte restaurant other than Pukka, but Pukka is fine dining, so different $ class.Still not sure how they got such amazing real estate right in Christie Pits park with parking...nothing like eating Indian food then playing some basketball in the park.",2019-01-25,5.0,Toronto,2,3,0
22,"Uh so I came here with a very hungry stomach and frankly wasn't all that satisfied. I ordered the seafood thali, which in other words is an ensemble of various Indian dishes in one plate; a seafood curry, jeera rice, aloo Gobi, daal and salty pakoras lmao. I know salt is a personal preference and all but lmao those were salty pakoras haha. I sound salty just talking about them. Haha no, yeah it's not funny. I don't like over salted food and both the pakoras and papad were really salty for my standards. And on the other hand the masoor daal was undersalted. Lol, but not funny.  I would say the best item from my thali was the aloo Gobi. I'm not gonna break it down and explain what that dish consists of, there is Google for that. But they do make a really nice aloo Gobi compared to a few other places I've tried. Nice thick chunks of gobi in a nice gravy. Now that's one dish I would recommend from Banjara.

We moved away from Toronto a few years ago and in this post Covid lockdown world we returned and were yearning for Banjara and an authentic Indian fix. What a disappointment!  Aside from the slow delivery, the dishes just didn't sing and zing off the place as they always did. Everything tasted pretty much the same. Palak Paneer was bland & watery. The butter chicken was just meh. Even the nans seemed hard and cardboard flavored. The lamb Seekh Kababs tasted like flavorless sponge.  I could go on but overall it was a huge disappointment. Perhaps it was our memory / anticipation that hit earth but I don't think so. Three of us who know good Indian, and were big Banjara fans for years felt the same, and we threw half of it away.

We chose a sauce that had this lime flavor to it and it was pretty good!The lamb was very tender and choosing the Madras sauce was a good recommendation from the server.As soon you walk in you are greeted. They bring you pappadum (cumin spiced chips). They come refill your water multiple times and is very polite.The space has like an inside area and a ""sun room"" area.

So when I lived near Banjara and got a whiff when the wind changed, I wasn't into it... but now that it's not part of my day to day life, man do I want it. I want it all of the time.

For several years, the prospect of the trip to the Christie Pits landmark would genuinely excite me, but hit has not been the case as of late. While the food is still OK, I no longer can find a particularly good reason for making the trek. The service was OK, though we did feel a bit rushed. Our group was seated next to the poorly ventilated kitchen and the smaller tables that were merged to seat us were comically different in size and misaligned. Though we tried a myriad of dishes, the butter chicken was the only one that tasted above average. The naans were also still tasty but I expect more than the bread to be on point when I visit the restaurant.

I rode my bike by the other day and noticed the open sign lit up and nearly squealed with joy and less than 48 hours later I was sitting among a crowd of other eager eaters at this park-adjacent temple of taste.

And I know I was not the only one - the barrage of ""noooooo"" 's I got from all over my various social media feeds is evidence of this. Anyway, suffice it to say, I was very happy to sit down, order a heaping plate of veggie thali (which for the uninitiated is sort of like if Indian curry and a party platter had a baby), and promptly eat the whole thing.

Walking in it doesn't seem like getting seating appears to be of any issues. Popped in at 7 PM on a Monday evening and was quickly seated. (usually about a 10 minute tops) The menu appears to have a vast selection from what I have seen. I ended up going for a more traditional dish while some friends have come here for Dosa. I ended up ordering the Lamb Masala also joining the table was the Chicken 65 and some Chicken Curry. The portions seem plentiful, and the sides of rice and garlic naan were a good and welcoming compliment to the entrees. Having the Lamb Masala, it was flavourful and a delightful dish packed with great flavor. Lamb was very tender, and the sauce packed with great flavor. If I come back, I would get the medium spice (took it safe since a recommendation of South Indian food being spicy)The Chicken 65 had a bit of a tandoori flavor with a good minor kick. A good appetizer to start out.The Dosa came on a large metal serving tray with a decent amount of potato. The sauces were unique, and one of them had a bit of a cardamom taste with gave a burst of delight. Overall a good place to visit that isn't too expensive.

However, the garlic naan had too much butter to which I didn't like.Overall, 2 stars because the food at this place is pretty good if you are looking for some Indian food, not sure about the authenticity though. But they need to do a better job on cleaning their dishes, wouldn't be happy to see dirty dishes again if I decide to come here again.",2017-08-10,2.0,Toronto,0,0,0
40,"First Indian restaurant in Toronto I've been to -  from the 'Sauga/Brampton area so there are loads of great choices and for all these years just never sought out Indian food when in Toronto. Read a BlogTO post that had Banjara in there, and thought ya know why not? It's right down the road from Eva's Chimneys which is a huge plus, so I decided to go here.From the second I pulled in, and yes I pulled into this place because there is actual parking which is so f'n rare to have! Only about 4-6 spaces, but I went at 12pm and was lucky enough to snag a spot. Already was liking this place before opening their doors.From the moment coming in the staff was super nice -  once sat down they served poppadom complementary. I love this, and miss it. IDK what it is, but I don't find enough places in the GTA serve poppadom to you before the meal. I'm from the NYC area originally, and I just recall almost every Indian place serving poppadom and with chutney too, before every meal. Indian places in the GTA should do this more please ;)So everything was off to a good start, food came out quick and it was very tasty. Had 2 different panner dishes to try and another diner had a chicken sagg which they loved, some vegie pakoras too. Staff again was super nice, attentive, always came by to fill up water. All in all if you are in Toronto and want to have Indian or better yet, go have Indian  THEN walk down the road to get Eva's right after this is the perfect place to go to. Do it, Banjara then Eva's it's a great combo.",2017-07-31,4.0,Mississauga,0,0,0
41,"The food is good but the place is very disorganized. It's likely because they don't have a POS system. Or maybe it was broken when I ate there last week. But the place was overstaffed and servers were taking orders on their phones. We were a table of 8 and had 4 servers working on our table. They brought an extra order of the pickled lemon (which no one ate because it didn't taste good). We told them we didn't order it and they still charged one of us for it. With so many staff, mistakes get made.Also, their mains don't come with rice or naan so you have to order it separately. They do have dinner combos but it's a lot of food you may not want and would therefore go to waste.",2019-12-21,3.0,Toronto,0,0,0

I got the butter chicken thali which included rice, naan, pakora and a couple of veggie curries for $11.99.The naan was delicious however I found the butter chicken was quite westernized.  I ordered mild and when I order mild at other Indian restaurants, there is usually some heat.  There was none here.  I think this place is a-ok for Indian food starters but if you are looking for very authentic, this may not the place.  So give it a try if you have friends that are apprehensive about Indian food, otherwise there are better options.Other pro's: service is great, nice ambiance.",2014-06-15,3.0,Mississauga,3,2,1
44,"If i could give a minus rating i would.   Went there last sunday (June 23rd?)with my boyfriend and a close friend who was visiting from out of town. No complaints about the food - however-  experienced the WORST customer service we've ever had at a restaurant.. Disorganized,  inept staff and  being blatantly accused  of not settling the bill when we had in fact paid already..Two incidents stand out - three different waitresses -within a space of 5 minutes - approaching our table to tell us kitchen is closing. Yes we get it. Time to settle up but just tell us once ....it wasn't late and we weren't only ones there no need to be pushy. 2nd -When bill had arrived my boyfriend paid cash (with a generous tip)to the waitress  only to have another waitress approach our table a minute or two later to ask us to  again settle up . When we told her that we had already  paid - she did not believe us.  She looked at us &  asked ""are you joking with me?"" with a raised eyebrow.  We told her ""No"" but clearly she did not believe us. As she kept lurking about and looking skeptically at us. My guest then decided to walk to the other room - where a bunch of waitresses were gathered-  to seek out the waitress who originally took our money. This waitress  denied THREE times she had  taken our money   -before she suddenly ""remembered"" when manager asked what was going on. I'm not sure if she was intending to pocket our money or was as clueless as she seemed. But an apology would have been nice.But none was offered. From her, from the manager or the one who accused us. They just shrugged it off and believe one of them might have laughed. Like what the heck????!!We're all pretty easy going but honestly i've never experienced anything like this before.

They have a ""indoor patio"" which adds to the place for seating and makes it a tad unique. The one thing that I found interesting is there is a small button like buzzer by your table. It's to notify the waitress/waiters that your ready to order or if anything is needed. I always felt a little hesitant to press it at times- but maybe that's just me! The service was very good! Attentive and quick.On to the food! We ordered Paneer Makhani, butter chicken, butter naan and saffron rice. When they came to the table, my tastebuds were jumping for joy! However, when I tasted the Paneer I felt that some flavour was lacking. The butter chicken was good once I ate more of it. But at first bites, my tastebuds were begging for more flavour. We also asked for ""Medium spice"" on everything and seemed to get very mild. The naan and rice were delicious though! So perhaps we needed to try other curries or get more of a mixture instead of two similar ones.Verdict? I will be back again to try it out and will order different ranges next time.

Once we were seated our server brought over water and a complimentary snack; 3 pieces of pita-size crackers baked with fennel seeds, yum! She notified us about the service button for when we were ready to order. Service here is prompt just the way I like it!We ordered the Butter Chicken (since it was recommended by many yelpers!), Pulao and Cauliflower Pakora. The Butter Chicken was served in a small circular pot; didn't anticipate it to be such a small portion but, there is the option to upsize! Chicken was kind of dry however, the creamy sauce complimented it and it also went well with the Pulao. The Pulao is cooked with various spices already and it's just as tasty on its own. As for the Cauliflowrr Pakora, I was not much of a fan. It's pretty much like tempura you'd get at a Japanese restaurant however, fried with a chickpea batter. I found it to be quite dry but, hey, if you enjoy cauliflower and chickpea then this is the appetizer for you! The goodness of this place does not stop here. Another AMAZING thing about this place is that it's affordable. When the bill came we were surprised to find the total to be around $23! Pulao for only $3.50?!?!  And the Cauliflower Pakora was around 4 bucks..?!(Even though the price of cauliflower nowadays has skyrocketed!) The most expensive item we had was the Butter Chicken, it was around $13 but even then, it's all worth it! Both of us shared the items and it was plentiful BUT, if you're a big eater then sharing won't do you well. Definitely will return to try the other items on the menu!",2016-02-10,5.0,Toronto,2,1,1

Prices are eminently reasonable and the portion size is good for at least 4 meals. They have their own delivery service and you thus miss all the cutesy addons (Doordash where are you?) which add on 15% to the food tab. Special mention to the beef vindaloo which is the best in town. The Madras Shrimp is also very good with lots of large shrimp in the mix. The spicing for each dish is quite distinct as opposed to the one size fits all sauces at places like Mother India. The opportunity to order beef dishes is a definite plus as well. Now if only they would do some Pork dishes I would be ecstatic.My only beef with them is they tend to sprinkle fresh coriander on top and I hate the taste of it.",2019-05-22,4.0,Toronto,0,0,1

It's also not too out of the way as it is located  within a 5 min walk from Christie subway station.I sat in their full windowed seating area wherw I was given a complimentary basket of chip/cracker things (I have no idea what they're called,  but I attached a picture and can assure you they were veeerryyy tasty!). I went with the chicken tikka masala, my brother and dad ordered the chicken vindaloo and the vutter chicken platter respectively. We also ordered a side of garlic rice and plain naan.Everything was delicious! Average sized portions, and even a little cheaper in price than standard Indian restaurants charge. Nothing was too spicy, or chewy; zero negativity!  The plain naan was perfect for all the sauce included in tue main meat diah. Although the platter certainly offered more variety, I would recommend that if you know what main dish you enjoy (like chicken tikka masala in my case), have an order of that and get either a side of rice or naan to conpliment the main dish. Only thing I wasn't crazy about was their rice pudding (included in the platter), I simply found it very sweet, but I can see how others may enjoy it :) I will most certainly return to Banjara, and if you're ever craving Indian cuisine,  this is the place to come!",2015-12-26,5.0,Toronto,1,1,0

64,"I went here this weekend with my partner on a Saturday night without reservations. Disclaimer: both my partner and I are of Indian decent and we eat a lot of Indian food on the regular so our standards/expectations are quite high. Also we prefer a certain level of spice for our indian food. Please keep this in mind when interpreting this review.Environment: on a Saturday night it is very busy and if you show up without a reservation you can expect a wait. They are not very accurate with their estimates of time. We were told 20 and it was closer to 45. The environment is low key. Not much for decor. Seats and tables are close together. There is no music (probably a good thing) however due to the crowd it can be quite loud. Not an ideal place for an intimate date night. Food: I ordered a chicken quick combo which came with chicken madras, Nan,  rice, rice pudding, aloo gobi and veggie pakoras for about 15. My partner got the same thing but veggie with paneer makhani. We ordered medium spicy. Our food came quickly since we ordered prior. Both orders were quite mild by our indian standards (so if you prefer spicy order spicy explicitly). Overall the food was ok nothing special as far as indian restaurants go.Service: staff was friendly but overwhelmed with customers and orders. However if you order your food before you are seated your food can be available for you as soon as you sit down which is nice. Aside from when the food was given to us we did not see our server at all (not even for water refill until the end).That said, this place is decent.

70,"After two mediocre Indian dinners, I needed to cleanse my palate and mind of those meals. Banjara was at the top of a list of highly-recommended places to try, so I chanced it and came here for dinner. Saturday night, 7 pm. Prime dinner time. There's no wait, but the place is lively. That's a good sign. The tables are a little too close together, but we can handle it. Service was pretty good tonight, perhaps because we were seated four feet from the host stand where all the servers congregate.Quick dinner combination seems to be the way to go: for $15 CAD, you get naan, rice, daal, veggie pakora, aloo gobi, rice pudding, and your choice of an entree. Great way to sample things. So my first night I got the lamb rogan josh (medium). It's a gamble because it's so easy to mess up lamb; it wasn't the most tender, but it was tasty. The daal was flavorless. I left it. Veggie pakora was amazing. I upgraded to garlic naan, but it honestly didn't make much of a difference flavor-wise. The aloo gobi is good. Rice and rice pudding were pretty standard and what you would expect; nothing special. Got our bill quickly and departed on a good note. The second time I came here was the very next day for dinner; apparently I hyped up my night a little too much to my boss. We got seated much further away this time, next to the windows in the back. We were told that there is a button under the table that signals your server. Well, the button did not work. When we flagged down a passing server, she said that it was broken. Great. Thanks. My boss ordered us the house mixed grill so we could try a bunch of things. The fish and chicken were the highlights of that dish; everything else was pretty gamey. Onions were on point, though. We both still opted for the dinner combo, and this time I got the chicken korma (medium). Just a brief note: medium isn't at all spicy. Choose to go heavier if you want a kick. Anyway, the korma was fantastic, but I had the same issue with the daal (no flavor) and garlic naan (not worth the price to upgrade). Everything else was solid. They brought us chutney this time as well, which I was not fortunate enough to get during my first experience (and probably would've enhanced the lamb). Service was MUCH slower this time around, and it didn't seem like any of the servers were more than passively working. I saw our server on her cell phone behind the host stand multiple times, chatting with the other ladies. I don't care if you chat on the job during downtime, but when people are trying to get your attention for things that they need to enjoy the meal or finish it, the least you could do is look up. Or have a working button. Second experience much more meh than the first. The food is around 3.5 stars, but the service and ambiance (or lack thereof, seeing as there's little space between you and your neighbor) drag this place down to 3 stars for me. Maybe I'll try take away next time.",2017-02-14,3.0,Los Angeles,3,1,1
71,This review applies for the takeout option only. One of my friend's family is partial to takeouts and go far to get their takeouts. Sometimes they are not too keen to drive out and settle on places within the city. Now that I have tried this spot twice I can form a better opinion.First pickup wasn't pleasant for moi as even though I stood in the entrance for a bit I was smelling of food afterwards (something that is quite unpleasant for winter clothing IMO). Next trip I wised up and just stayed out till the food was ready.Hmm first of the spice level is held back quite bit if you order medium spicy. This is probably to appeal to the western palate. Secondly I don't think their meat dishes are up to par. Now this is comparing with other takeout places my friends frequent. The chicken boti dish I tried was dry and devoid of taste. Sure there was the food coloring to give the appearance of spicy but this is just a tad over food court level.I think they do better with dishes that are either vegetarian or are accompanied by vegetables. On this visit we ordered the chicken with palak and that was decent.I would say 2.5 stars.,2017-01-25,2.0,Toronto,3,0,0

We got the shrimp pakora, veggie samosas, green beans, butter chicken, and garlic naan.It was all so ho-hum. There is a word in Hindi - swad. Swad is more than just flavour - it is the lip smacking that occurs after having an incredible bite. Indian* food is usually packed with swad. This had none. Not worth the calories. I will say their butter chicken had huge chunks of white meat which some places do lack. Other places to go - Lahore Tikka House, The Host, Bukkhara Grill (in sauga). Overall - wouldn't come back. *Indian food is a misnomer. India is a massive country with many different languages, ingredients and culture. The food that represents North India is completely different than South India - so really there is no such thing as ""Indian"" food.

83,"While I had some expectations for this place, I'm disappointed.  It's fresh, well prepared, but the spices aren't working.  Got the Lamb Vindalloo (spicy), the Chana Masala (spicy), Saffron Rice, Bhajis, Garlic Naan.  The Bhajis are more like flat Pakoras, and their accompanying white sauce is not very good while I often find Tamarind sauce with Bhajis being excellent.  Best Bhajis I know are Canbe Foods.  The Garlic Naan seems like a Naan with garlic as an afterthought.  And the garlic is yellow for some reason.  Best Garlic Naan I know of is in-house ordered at New Haandi on Gerrard.  Saffron Pulao is pretty much nondescript.  Lamb Vindaloo was ordered spicy, and is acceptable.  Some medicinal nasal flavours in there, and it's not pleasant.  This is not a strong Heng application.  Butter Chicken is the gateway to Indian food for muzungus.  I make better Makhni Sauce at home than most restaurants.  Chana Masala was also ordered spicy.  It's a bit dry for a CM.  Also medicinal.  Found a chili that I popped into my mouth, and it tasted burnt.  It is very hard to find a brilliant Indian meal in this town.",2017-08-21,3.0,EAST YORK,0,0,0

The place is often packed and yet the takeouts are just as good. Portions are generous and prices are great for the magical culinary journey that your tongue is about embark on.

87,"This used to be my favourite Indian restaurant - their paneer makhani was irresistible. However the last two times I've ordered from here, both in the past month, the quality has been lower and the gravy recipe changed drastically enough to notice. On the previous order we had the butter chicken and samosas. The samosas were dry and the butter chicken tasted very different from usually. I thought it was just an off-day as we order from here once every month or two and this had never happened before. I was embarrassed that I'd recommended this ""best butter chicken in Toronto"" to my friend that day and he couldn't even finish the dish, but figured it was a bad day for the kitchen or something.The second time, I experienced similar problems. I had the paneer makhani, my favourite, and the paneer pieces were half their usual size with fewer pieces. There were randomly peas in the gravy. The spices were also a different ratio from usual, altering the taste. The garlic rice was quite a bit greasier as well. The food was cold when it arrived (again).Very disappointing - I will be looking elsewhere for our Indian orders from now on.

91,"We got take out from Banjara and we were very pleased. The food was tasty and very plentiful!  I find that many Indian restaurants offer very small portions, but not this place. The prices were reasonable too. Theirs is the type of Indian food that is ""street style"" and is heavy on the sauce. They remind me a little of the Pakistani restaurant Lahore Tikka House (which is quite compliment, as I'm a big fan of LTH.)  If you're looking for more refined Indian food, you may want to try the Host, Babur or Pukka.  They have their own website for ordering and it's very easy to use - even grandma can do it. You can specify the amount of spice you want on each dish individually. They do require 60-90 minutes for delivery, but they were nice enough to deliver all the way to Eglinton for us. Here's a description of what we ordered:Tandoori Chicken - full Price: 17.99Rate: 4/5Nice tandoori, but a bit heavy on the spice rub, a bit too salty and a bit dry.Seekh KebabPrice: 12.50Rate: 3/5As far as Seekh kebabs go, it was only average. It was a little salty, and unbalanced in flavor. The consistency of the minced meat was a little mushy.Butter ChickenPrice: 12.99Rate: 4/5The sauce was very nice, but the chicken itself was a bit dry.Chicken CurryPrice: 11.99Rate: 5/5Very nice dish. Meat was nice and moist.Daal with SpinachPrice: 10:50Rate: 2/5This wasn't my favorite dish. It was a little watery and a little bitter.Chana MasalaPrice: 9.95Rate: 5/5Very tasty dish.

100,"I'm sad to write this review because I have been a loyal Banjara customer for years. I travelled from across the city to have dinner at the Bloor St. location and had a very unfortunate experience. We arrived a bit before the restaurant opened and were waiting in our car, which was parked in the parking lot. One of the delivery drivers smashed into the side of our parked car, t-boning it. We got out to check the damage and ask for his insurance information. The driver, along with several other delivery drivers, laughed at us and said the damage was already there. We could see many staff inside the restaurant also laughing and pointing at us. The driver who hit our car was rude and refused to give us his insurance information until I said we would contact the police to report the accident. We decided to stay for dinner because we had travelled all the way there. The driver that hit our car then came into the restaurant after us and started yelling at us asking for our driver's license. The manager of the restaurant watched the interaction but did not do anything until I called for help from a manager. He then took the driver to the back room. About halfway through our dinner, the owner of the restaurant came out and said the drivers are not fluent in English. Nobody apologized to us. We paid our bill and left.

Then he told us that he would just drive to Queen and we could walk 2 blocks to come and pick it up. Uh... No. My boyfriend told him that Bathurst was open south of Queen and that he could find his way here on the side streets. When the food arrived it looked ok. We ordered the Saag Paneer, Butter Chicken, Lamb Madras and Bhartha. To be honest, none of it tasted that great. All if the respective meat dishes were moist, but the sauces all had a consistency that was a little unpleasant. The bharta tasted smoky, but almost artificial and one if the dishes had whole back cardamom pods on it. Unlike their green counterparts, they can a little nasty when they break open in your mouth.It was nice that they included papadam with the order.

122,"The quality of the food dropped significantly as their popularity increased. I ordered from them their very first month in business, which was something like 2006 and was pretty regular for many years, but have no desire to eat there anymore.Banjara became popular when the area started picking up around 2008. The front patio was a big draw and had a nice atmosphere on a summer's night, so they got a lot of sit down business.Around the same time the quality of the food started to slide but the prices remained high for the area and the portions small. I began to feel ill after eating there. I only eat vegan but wonder if ghee made it into my food, even though I always specified. A quick glance at their DineSafe history shows two yellow cards in 2013 where pest control, failure to wash hands, failure to wear hair nets among other things cited. Not exactly reassuring.On top of that, they have had this broken down old truck sitting in the parking lot for at least 6 years and it has never moved, tires are flat. It's an eyesore and takes up parking spaces, so why keep it there? Maybe it's a load-bearing truck that keeps the sign from falling down?They also added some shipping containers by the back side door off the kitchen where you can see people doing food prep sometimes when the door is open. Yup, food is being prepped inside of shipping containers.Then they screened in the patio, which made it lose all that nice summery appeal and instead felt like you were eating your grandparent's musty screened in porch.I now go to South Indian Dosa Mahal for my Indian fix. Sure, it's not the same type of cuisine and the place has no atmosphere to speak of, but the food is prepared fresh when you order off menu, it's completely veg and the price is right.I recommend giving Banjara's filtered reviews a read through as well for a full picture.*For locals interested in area history, if you walk around the back of Banjara you can still see the ""Coffee Tip"" sign from when it was a sketchy Coffee Time rip off circa 2000.Update: The orange Banjara truck appears to have been repainted by graffiti ""artists"" and is now by the back kitchen door and the shipping containers are now in the parking lot.",2014-10-18,1.0,San Francisco,9,5,1

134,"Within the Annex neighbourhood, Banjara is among the better Indian cuisine restaurants. The curries are typically good, and quite large portions... you can definitely share 1 order between 2 (maybe even 3) people.They seem to always be busy, so if you are doing take-out or delivery, order well in advance. I had a delivery order take close to 2 hours the other day, and the items all arrived a mediocre ""warm"".... disappointing after such a long wait.We have tried their kormas, masalas, vindaloos, etc... never been disappointed with a curry. Their raita is quite watery, and I prefer a much thicker raita... but that is my personal preference. The naan's are usually quite fresh as well.Overall, it's decent food...

This was the tandoori meat and naan that I can smell.We asked for a table for two which we got after waiting for 10 minutes on a busy evening at 8. I like the servers here and must say they were very warm. Soon we got the table and our order was taken swiftly. We waited for 20 minutes for the appetizers and mango milk shakes to arrive which I would say was worth the wait.As we proceeded with the main course, Banjara continued to flatter us with the quality of the food. We ordered very spicy and hot version and we got it exactly how we like. I must say there is a huge scope for improvement for garlic naan as it was very low on salt and the half cooked garlic was little depressing.

Indian foods *need* the spices cooked in from the start - which is why a good Indian restaurant will *never* ask you how spicy you want a given dish - They are prepared to be of a certain piquancy.From what I can tell, Banjara add the heat on demand based on how ""hot"" you order the food. It's very much the North American way and it doesn't get the best out of their obvious talents. I, personally, order the food ""As if the chef were eating it"" and that tends to be close enough given there's very little competition for Indian food in the area.On the whole, I do keep going back as there's so much to choose from and you probably will, too.",2018-01-21,4.0,Old Toronto,0,0,0

The chicken tikka, the mushroom curry, the palak paneer, and the malai kofta. My favourite of the four was the chicken masala, and not only because it was the only meat dish, but was just the yummiest. The sauce of the malai kofta was pretty great though.

The portions of the rice was not enough to finish the butter chicken but then again butter chicken is mental to eat with naan. When I asked for the butter chicken the waiter asked how spicy I wanted it and I took the spiciest they make it, to my surprise they actually made it spicy and still flavourful. The rice had the aroma and the hint if cream and spices was present in the rice such as nutmeg and other good things.I half to get a naan because the rice only let me finish 75 persent of the butter chicken. They also ask you if you want the naan with butter or plain. To finish off i got a mango lassi which was ok not the best but i have the feeling it's pre made because as soon as i ordered it she came back in less than a minute with a tall glass of mango lassi with a straw.

181,"Okay guys. Take it from an East Indian woman. This is the best Indian food in the city. My in laws who live in Brampton (also known for the very high Indian population) come all the way from there to have Indian food in downtown Toronto at Banjara. I didn't even know this gem of a place existed until I met my husband 5 years ago. This is not a classy, pretty, well decorated restaurant like Dhaba or Aroma on King St. W. It's a fast moving, crowded, in and out restaurant. What it lacks in ambiance, elegance and style, it makes up ten fold in quality of food. It is no surprise why this place is always always full. And it's not only filled with Indian patrons, but non Indian folk as well. It doesn't matter if you've grown up eating Indian food or eat it once in a while or are just getting accustomed to the cuisine, this is a restaurant that makes everyone want to come back for more.There are buttons at every table that you press when you are ready to order your food and magically a waitress or waiter will appear. It is that hectic and that busy that they need buttons! My favourite dishes here are the Butter Chicken, Baigan Bharta, Matar Paneer and Any of the Biryanis. Even though these are my go to dishes, I am sure that most dishes here are just mouth watering delicious. I was skeptical when my husband had told me about this place and it being the best in the city, priding myself on being quite the Indian food connoisseur but when I saw that Banjara was the number 1 restaurant on many sites I knew I had to give it a chance. Well once I did, I've been here many times knowing I will never leave disappointed.One tip, if you live in their delivery zone, I find that if you get take out, because their containers are larger than the bowls they use at the restaurant, you actually get more food for the same price when you get it delivered or pickup to go. And unlike other cuisines like sushi or pizza, eating Indian food (especially Indian food from Banjara) served at the table fresh, or half and hour later in a container, it will be just as good!",2017-06-01,5.0,Old Toronto,0,0,0

With an engulfing whiff of the scrumptious and intoxicating aromas as I first stepped foot inside Banjara, I had an inkling that it was going to be as good as I had heard.    Word of mouth took me to this wonderful establishment at the corner of Bloor and Crawford (just west of Christie Pits park and a step from my door) and it lived up to it's reputation. You can take my word-of-mouth to heart; delicious and well priced dishes, including both meat and veggie delights!    Recently, a South Indian Cuisine restaurant opened right next door called Madras Masala, inevitably by the owners of Banjara and I can not wait to try it next!

186,"When your Indian friends tell you that this is one of the best spots for Indian food in the city, you have pretty high expectations. ""The best? In the whole city?! Get outta here...""On a Sunday night we tried to just stroll in during prime dinner time: bad idea. The place was busy and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. Apparently other people like to go here as well.I was a big fan of the free papadam, I went through 3 or 4 of them while we were waiting for our dishes. They're basically cumin chips - and you can cover it with the sweet sauces they have sitting on the table - awesome!We split a few dishes. We get a fish, lamb and chicken curry. To be honest I can't remember exactly which curries we got, but I don't think you can go wrong with any of them, they were all great.  The naan was soft; I normally prefer naan a little crispier but it was good stuff nonetheless.I didn't like the kebab we had as a starter though -  I though the meat was mushy and I didn't enjoy the texture very much. Best in the city? I'll have to come a few more times before I'm willing to give it that crown.

I love that you get to choose your spice level from mild to very hot. We got medium hot and were left with a pleasant spiciness in the back of our throats (not mouth numbing). The chicken korma was moist and flavourful, the mutter paneer had amazing texture and the sauce was so creamy and comforting and the saag chicken was less saucy than I am used to and you know what? I liked it better. The pakoras were standard. Mango lassi was awesome....thick and creamy and tart.

197,"Is an amazing Indian food restaurant in your neighbourhood a reason for you not to move? Maybe if it is as good as Banjara, but I ended up moving anyways. Living close to Banjara is great because take-out is your best option for enjoying this food. You get a larger portion and you don't have to wait for a table since it is sometimes busy. Eating-in isn't a grand experience anyways because not much has changed in this place since it was a Coffee Tip (yes, Tip not Time). The only cool thing about eating-in is sitting by the kitchen and getting a glimpse of the tandoor flames and the chefs cooking.Having had most things on the menu, I would suggest skipping the appetizers. The Samosas and Pakoras are nothing special. Also, they are not great for take-out. Curries are the best in my opinion - I love any of the Kormas, Chicken Saag, and Mushroom Curry. You can't order without a side chewy, buttery Naan. I would also suggest the Rice Pudding which is spiced with saffron and cardamom (sometimes sneak it into your take-out for free).",2013-10-03,5.0,Toronto,1,2,1

It was enough food to render us completely useless for the rest of the evening and serve as our lunch the following day (in case you're wondering about the whole fridge thing, we kept the leftovers in the wine fridge for the night).If you're eating in, then order the mixed plate with a bunch of different curries.

202,"Banjara is simply the best. I was introduced to this restaurant by friends about 5 years ago and I've been a regular ever since. My favourite dish is the Paneer Makhani. It's one of the richest, creamiest Indian dishes I've ever eaten. I cannot stop ordering this dish; it's becoming a bit of a problem. It goes so well with a side order of rice or some naan bread (get the garlic naan - you shan't be disappointed). Other favourite dishes include:- Mutter Paneer (a slight variation on the Paneer Makhani, only with peas!)- Saag Aloo (great combination of flavours in this dish)- Chicken Curry (the sauce in this dish is outstanding - this dish is a must-order)- Lamb Vindaloo (excellent, just excellent - get it spicy if you are up to the challenge)If you like spicy food, you can ask them to custom make any dish with extra spice. Otherwise, the dishes will usually be quite mild.One word of advice: only order take-out or delivery from here. They have seating at the restaurant but it's always packed and the service is disorganized and slow. Be prepared to wait up to 2 hours for delivery on Friday and Saturday evening during peak times (5pm-7pm).",2013-06-13,5.0,Toronto,4,1,0

206,"This place is OK depending on what you're looking for.  I've been eating ""Indian food"" for a long time since I was a child so I'm a little bit critical when it comes to flavour.  Overall the service was very good... they have a doorbell system in place at your table where you ring the bell for your server similar to what I've seen at Korean restaurants.Once we were seated we were greeted with Papadum's (often referred to as cracker things) and two sauces, one which was a chutney which was good and the other yogurt based sauce with mint, cilantro, etc. which was also good.We started off by ordering the veggie pakora.  It came out quickly and paired OK with the chutney but was a bit stodgy and was not piping hot as if it just came out of the deep fryer as we were hoping it would have been.For the main course we ordered the chicken biryani, garlic naan, butter chicken and palak paneer.Of all of the four the palak paneer was definitely the best.  It had decent flavour and was good compared to some other Indian restaurants I have been to in Toronto.The garlic naan was very good... along with the palak paneer they were definitely the highlights of the meal.We were impressed by the fact that the butter chicken came packed with chicken for the price we paid but tasted extremely, extremely bland and had little to no flavour, at all... it seemed like the chicken was literally breast meat cubed up and thrown into the sauce.  Very disappointed in this dish.  It tasted like store shelf butter chicken sauce (maybe even worse).The chicken biryani was just OK.  Same cubed up breast meat we had in the butter chicken but the flavour was just lacking and needed the cilantro/mint sauce added to it to make it desirable to eat.  It had whole seeds in it which I assumed would have made the flavour more intense but it just didn't for some reason.Overall Banjara is probably a good place to go if you're new to Indian food and do not like spices and complex flavours but favour quantity over quality.  Personally I would not go back again with so many other better choices around the GTA.  Not sure how this place got 4 out of 5 stars... seriously.",2016-09-05,2.0,Toronto,0,0,0

208,"Indian food is funny. It always insights three major decisions: 1. F I'm white, I forgot to tell them ""hey, I'm not white on the inside."" 2. Naan or rice? No, naan and rice, but damnit I hate the bill when I see it charged. 3. How come in Indian food terms... two entrees is never enough? It's always two meats & a side entree to share. It always turns out perfect, which is why I hold it too a higher level in my dining out than the ol' Canadian (New) of single entrees and fried appetizers. The passing of entrees... the sharing of left overs. The eating with hands with shared naan. It takes on its own/better way of dining. Damn do I dislike tablecloths and rooms without music, and that's what we have here. I'll never get over how much I don't like it and I'll never get over how anywhere I've traveled with an Indian restaurant comes this. And ghee, this food is heavy. The standard three entree situation is not necessary. Leftovers can happen with two, and one entree with naan is honestly enough food. If there's one entree to get... it's mater paneer. Or, maybe, the lamb vindaloo. Okay, just get both. The butter chicken is like biting a stick of butter like a candy bar. Don't do it. I blew their minds with asking for ice with the masala chai.

The front of house staff is attentive and nice, they refill water regularly and, they are very well informed about the menu. The chefs are very accommodating when you need something withheld from a dish, they adjust spiciness perfectly, and get food out promptly. The prices are all very reasonable. The restaurant is kept clean, and has a nice atmosphere (except for those buzzers by the table for buzzing the waiters/waitress'.)-------------------------------The Negative: There have been a couple instances where the cut of chicken used had a muscle in it. When I think about Butter Chicken I think about nice pieces of meat I can chew and swallow; not pieces of chicken that require me to hide my face behind a napkin while I struggle to pull the tough nugget of muscle out of the mouth as stealthy as possible without ruining the appetite of all those around me, and my fiancee is like, ""Brian what are you doing?! Don't put that in the napkin! The waitress will have to clean that later."" and i'm like ""Well what else can I do with it? I cant just swallow, I'll choke!"" But I digress. I want to mention that this is not the average experience, but happened enough times with the chicken and lamb that I figured i'd mention it.-------------------------------The Conclusion: Banjara is a great restaurant with a great staff.

234,So I've been here a few times. The quality and freshness of the food is difficult to beat. The servers are patient and helpful. We ended up getting the Combo Platters for dinner. I had the lamb and boyfriend had the butter chicken. Both were great! Good value for the money - choice of side dishes with rice pudding for dessert.

238,I went on a Thursday night and order food for take out. The restaurant was very busy and a little too hectic for a nice sit down dinner so I would probably stick to take out.The food was decent but not mind blowing.What we ate:- chicken tikka masala (4/5): developed tastes and fresh. - Daal makhani (3/5): good flavor a little to creamy for my liking- garlic naan (1/5): overkill on the garlic!- pea pulao rice (3/5): pretty fresh but a little overwhelming with the curry dishesI would give this place one more shot just because my fellow Yelpers seem to love it!,2012-10-01,3.0,Toronto,2,3,1

We found out at the end that there was a button next to the table we were supposed to press if we wanted them to come over. Completely non-obvious to newbs.

It appeared as though it had been a very long time since the bathroom was cleaned. The  oversized waste bins were  overflowing  with trash and the open drain on the floor caked with mud and something wet.  The walls were filthy, paint pealing. I lost my appetite.

245,"When this place opened about 4-5 years ago I LOVED it. Honestly, I was so happy that I could finally get decent Indian food in my hood'! I was seriously suffering from withdrawal after having moved back from the U.K. and could only find crap Indian.Now, it's still good but I have to say it's gone downhill over the years. With popularity it has given way to smaller less tasty portions, crappier service, less meat in dishes than previous, etc. You know the drill.On top of that, the place is always rammed so it's a waiting game. You 're best to get take away.Now, the best thing about it that I discovered more recently, is that you can ask for them to use less oil in your dishes (because if you eat here you know the dishes are usually drowning in oil). I love the Lamb Rogan Josh, for example, without the oil. With the oil I gain 10 pounds just looking at it. In brief, there are many great dishes here but they are not up to the quality they once were. Go here with high expectations that are slightly curbed, get take away to avoid the bad service and long wait, and ask for less oil in your dishes to avoid cardiac arrest!",2012-10-15,3.0,Niagara,2,0,0
246,wouldn't rate it very high as some of the previous reviewers did. I prefer the near by madras masala. but it also might be my bias towards dosas. well I was impressed by jeera rice - it was a nice touch. but the other two dishes... eggplant with tomatoes and hmmm the other dish escapes my mind... anyway both of them were a bit too mushy for my liking. not my fave for the prices.,2013-01-13,3.0,Toronto,1,0,0

248,"I got a veggie combo for delivery as well as the samosa. I wouldn't say I am an expert at Indian food however I thought it was very good for fast take out. The delivery took about an hour however the man explained to me the reason why it was long because my other order was for butter chicken and that took long to cook. Orginally he said it was going to be 60 to90 minutes and I was going to cancel the order if it was going to be 90 minutes because would just be too long be he assured me he would only be 60 minutes and the delivery man did come in an hour. The veggie combo was about 12 dollars but it was a lot of food so it was soooo worth. Really delicious and so filling.

251,"Solidly good dining experience with pros and cons to it.Dinner menu is reasonably priced with sharable entrees, which is nice. We were 3. We ordered the Tandoori Fish (salmon), Malak Paneer and Butter chicken.-The fish was nicely cooked albeit a little overdone as it came on a fajita-like sizzling platter. It looked delish but a little dry and tasted salty. It came with a lot though and was good value.-The Paneer was nice and had basically the same sauce as the butter chicken.-The butter chicken was a little dry. The sauce was good and had flavour and spice but I felt spice wasn't balanced enough in either dish (we ordered hot). The thing is, it mostly just tasted tomatoey and peppery which isn't -really- a bad thing but I like my butter chickens to come through really sweet and nutty at the same time.-My friend got the salty lassi, and it tasted good, but was so small for the price! -Similar feeling for the dessert we ordered - and I loved the Rasmalai (it's like sweet curdled milk balls) but it was 4.50 for only two pieces.The service was kinda varied. There is a funny ring-bell you need to push. Our main waitress was friendly and attentive but most others seemed indifferent and didn't speak really. -Our rice never arrived so we had to ring to ask, and it came shortly after. -My friend was irritated with the woman who came to clean the table because she was taking away plates without asking, when my friend wasn't done with them. -Also that particular waitress waited around for my friend to finish which was a little awkward.SO! overall it's good, but I have another favourite in the area, so a MAYBE for return visit.",2013-05-23,3.0,Toronto,0,0,0

On the other hand, their online order service is very easy to use so that is a bonus.Be wary of the 'spice levels'. There were 6: mild, mild-medium, medium, medium-hot, hot and spicy.

258,"1.5 stars (because the Paneer Tikka and Paneer Makhani were just delicious).We went to Banjara for dinner on a Tuesday night to celebrate a birthday. There was ample parking. The place appeared quite full. The ambiance was old and boring. For appetizers, we ordered the Paneer Tikka (amazing when piping hot), chicken tikka (very poorly spiced), cauliflower tikka (meh) and vegetable pakoras (meh). For the mains we had Dal curry, spinach, veg korma, andhra chicken and paneer makhani. Everything except the paneer was just awful. Although the naan was warm (we ordered garlic and methi), that is to be expected from every Indian restaurant which serves punjabi food.  Seeing as to how this place is owned by Andhra people, we ordered the Biryani, which sucked. It seemed as though they had large pre made batches of the stuff and they just spooned some into a serving dish.The staff was friendly but just terrible at service. When we asked our server for her recommendations, she had none! Also,  we had to beckon them repeatedly to place our order, clear our plates, etc. while they huddled around playing on their iphones. We ordered some wine with the dinner and the server put the unopened bottle of wine (luckily it had a twist cap) on our table and walked away! lol Overall: The food was terrible, and the service was bad.

Portion size was huge, and they put a lot of pieces of tender chicken breast, not just a few chunks of cheaper dark meat like some restaurants. Delivery took an hour which is very reasonable.

266,"Wow, this place was such a disappointment. I was all prepared to love Banjara considering the rave reviews on Yelp, but it didn't meet my high expectations, and Yelpers tend to spot the strengths. The restaurant has a kitschy Bombay Palace- circa 1990 style. Not a great look considering this place was purchased from a coffee shop not that long ago. I don't claim to be a food connoisseur, but Indian food I know really well actually, having grown up with it, and having been to the best of the best of Indian restaurants in India and Toronto. Banjara, first of all, is not run by Indian chefs. Now I don't really care who makes my food, but Indian food is a highly creative cuisine, and the variety, freshness, and assembly of ingredients is almost wholly based on the origin of the chefs. He or she can make or break the best managed restaurants through their cultural lean; -Northern Punjabi/Mughlai food tends to be creamy, nutty, with saffron, turmeric, cumin, etc. made with ghee and meats are marinated with yoghurt. -Western is sweeter, and tends to use less onions, garlic.-Southern is typically spicy, peppery and is generally oil and water-based, and never creamy nor sweetened.The chefs are Sri Lankan and you can taste it in the food. The spices are southern and lacking in that creamy, nutty, yoghurt based texture seasoned palates come to expect from Mughlai cuisine. Further, the food here isn't fresh. The watery residue from reheating a meal was more than obvious from my Chicken Tikka Masala. Again, if it were fresh, it wouldn't be watery. I noticed mango lassi being prepared right at the bar area from a mango puree can. If you aren't going to make a lassi from scratch, which sadly is extremely easy and inexpensive to do, at least be discrete about it. I also spotted a huge can of Ketchup and MDH grocery store masala on a shelf in the kitchen from my seat. Any semi-decent Indian chef will tell you that you should *always* be making your dishes from freshly ground spices. +1 star for attentive staff. There are some far better options for quality, authentic North Indian food downtown.",2010-11-08,2.0,Toronto,8,5,7

268,"As soon as you step inside, your first thought will likely be that there is no possible way this place was built to be an Indian restaurant. The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only décor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.Savoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.Now, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.Pleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.I know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me. But if you're after more than just amazing Indian food, like say, an authentic setting and traditionally dressed staff, then you may want to keep looking; you won't find that here. What you will find is skillfully cooked, delicious food served to you by exceptionally attentive, friendly staff.",2011-01-12,5.0,Toronto,8,1,2

273,"My fiance and I decided to try Banjara for the first time on Valentine's Day of 2015. After an amazing experience, this is now our ""go-to"" Indian place. Unfortunately we once experienced bad service where we waited 45 minutes to get our appetizer only to realize they had lost our order and it never made it to the kitchen. They gave us 20% off our meal and were very apologetic. We decided to give the restaurant another chance after this and have experienced nothing but great service- must have just been an off day. I have tried many Indian restaurants in Toronto and this is definitely one of my favourites. The food is always good, hot, and fresh. The Malai Kofta here is the best I have ever had with a sauce so decadent and so delicious that just the thought makes me drool. I would list this as one of the most delicious sauces I have ever had. Every time we have ordered this dish we lick our plates clean. Seriously!Other dishes we have tried here are the Chicken Samosas which were very good and not overly spicy (we can't handle much spice), the Pakora- I wish were more crispy- most times we have ordered it, it is  fairly doughy on the outside when you are expecting a crisp bite. We have also ordered the Navratan Korma, the Chicken Korma, the Butter Chicken and the Mutter Paneer. All dishes have been very good, however, the Malai Kofta takes the cake.

274,"Banjara is a freakin' Christie Pitts miracle.  I am a regular there and I can vouch for its consistency and total deliciousness.  Here's my top ten list for what makes Banjara great:10. It's cleaned up the neighbourhood.  That store used to be a seedy Coffee Time.  Then, it was a seedier, ""Coffee Top"" - yup, the new owners didn't bother changing the sign.  Then, if you can believe it, it was a ""Coffee Tip""!  (That was the last straw).  Banjara rescued that little restaurant space next to the park from being forever only a place that only truck drivers or very, very stoned high school students would want to go.9. Friendly staff.  I've met the owner of Banjara twice and he is lovely.  He is humble and friendly and clearly aims to please.  The waitstaff there are quite warm (if not particularly boisterous) and they do a bang-up job playing tetris each night with the hordes that crowd into the restaurant at dinner time.  Sometimes they actually don't do a great job, but we forgive them.  The food is really worth it.8.  Hot means hot.  They've toned down their spice quite a bit from when they first opened (no doubt to sooth our wimpy Canadian tongues), but they can really crank up the heat on demand.  And they always ask how you like it.  With a Kingfisher and some Naan?  Perfect.7. Whole tandoori cauliflower.  Tender, flavourful, sizzling.  Did I mention sizzling?6. Variety.  Daal Makhani is creamy and rich, a typical northern Indian sauce.  But Daal with spinach is light with south Indian curry leaves.  Aloo Baingan sees big chunks of eggplant left in tact, along with creamy pieces of potato, while their Baingan Bharta is super smokey, rich and buttery with tons of ginger.  The spinach fry is spicy and full of spinach flavour not masked by other spices.  5. Convenience.  This area is dying for more good restaurants and (as the dozens of reviews attest) Banjara is in walking distance to those of us living in the area, it has free parking and is right next to the park to boot.  So you can walk off your ghee filled stomach watching kids making out by the swings.4. Rustic spices.  I love dishes that are both complex but you can also taste the individual flavours.  Eating through a dish at Banjara, you bite down on a cardamom pod, a bit of star anise, a crunch of ginger, a dainty curry leaf.  Each flavour is pungent and just right.3. You can tell that each chef has their own unique flair.  We order a lot of the same dishes frequently and each time, while clearly the same recipe, they have a little something different.  One chef loves more ginger, another makes the eggplant a little smokier, you get the idea.  We really enjoy those little differences, since the quality stays high.2. Mango Lassi.  Sour, sweet, cold, creamy.1. Leftovers the next day!Vegetarian score = 9/10.  Large variety of flavours and dishes and no doubts about hidden meat buried in sauces...",2011-04-26,5.0,Toronto,4,2,3
275,"Was there last week to check it out. Some Yelpers of good repute gave it some good reviews and I need an Indian fix STAT! So we dropped by to check this out. HINT: Locale is not big on reservations on a busy evening --which is to say almost most of them, so call in and say that ""you are on your way and will be there in 20min.!"" They might take your name and your party's number and hey, when you get there you just saved yourself a 20min. wait. Voila!The locale is kinda of tacky-looking but in a good way. Also, if you are going to have a serious dinner here at night, do yourself a favour and don't wear natural fabrics, otherwise they will reek to Indian food for a day or so... Just like when you to go Tikka! :-PNow, to the food... it's alright and somewhat tasty. Definitely worth exploring if you live in the area and don't want to travel far, but far from succulent or orgasmic, like I was led to hope and believe. Service was attentive but for example, the chicken tandoori in my mix meat platter, was as dry as a Scotman's whiskey bottle. Come on Banjara, the place was literally PACKED, so you had to be making tons of this stuff. It's inexcusable to mess up such a simple and highly ordered dish.Our Pulao rice was a bit on the dry side too(?!). So, our meal was as such that we were forced, mid-meal to order a butter chicken if just to use the sauce to mix in with the dry stuff. That's seriously not cool. The Daal With Spinach was alright, although again, it feel a bit too dry, as if it had been made a while ago and just reheated, you can tell by how dishes like this begin to crust as they cool. It wasn't bad, but I have had better. Honestly, I give this place 2 stars for the food and 1 extra star just for the place. It was a bit fun --mind you I was on a fun date. It was cool to see it packed like that, and the servers were attentive, but at $50 for two people, with no alcohol included, I definitely have had better at this level/price point. A pity. I probably won't be back.",2012-01-09,3.0,Guelph,3,1,0
276,"Bajara was one of the first restaurants I tried here when I first came up. I was hunting for an indian place and I saw that this one came highly recommended by yelpers.I love this place. Every time I've gone the food has been extremely tasty. However, what puts this place into my *awesomest restaurant ever* category is that they have a sampler platter. I fully admit that I suffer from food ADD. I would rather have 10 small bites than one large single item.  So the sampler platter here is tailor made for me. It's extremely filling and I adore that it comes with dessert. Every item I've had has been good. The butter chicken is amazing. The dahl makhani, one of my favorite dishes in all creation, is also super tasty.The staff is fairly friendly and mostly prompt. I've only had to wave them down once in the 3 times I've eaten there.The only downside to the restaurant is the rather small dining area. The lack of a true waiting area makes the place feel fairly cramped.",2010-03-04,5.0,Champaign,5,0,1
277,"I have grown up eating Indian food and suitably capable for identifying the best Indian eateries in GTA. For me, Banjara is right up there among the best Indian food places which deliver as well. I prodded five of my now brown friends from Montreal to go to this restaurant. For folks who haven't been to this place before, the layout of the restaurant is kinda clumsy. When you enter, you don't see a receptionist to ask for tables. Instead you see a bar counter with hordes of servers scurrying around. You go and ask them to be seated. I was asked to order the food (wondering if it had anything to do with my ethnicity ;). We ordered two butter chicken, chicken korma, daal makhani, tandoori platter and naan. To my pleasant surprise the server asked me about the level of spiciness that I wanted. Mild was the flavor of the table, hence that's what I asked for. 15 minutes later the food arrived. Food didn't look that presentable, only because of the low lighting which the restaurant has. But the food was A-awesome for everyone. Here is the individual review:1. Butter Chicken: One of the best, if not the best I have had in Toronto. Creamy & buttery with big juicy pieces of chicken. The quantity was sufficient for three people (yes, we are light eaters). 2. Chicken Korma: Very rich and heavy with equally big chunks of chicken. I wonder how they can afford to keep the prices at $10.99 for that much chicken! Nonetheless, the dish was just perfect for my white friends, who couldn't be bothered to eat spicy food at all! 3 Tandoori Platter: Mix of Tandoori Chicken, Seekh Kebab, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Prawn & Fish. All of the individual items were savory and seasoned with tasty spices. They all tasted very good and we all were practically fighting for the last few pieces of the Chicken Tikka. 4. Daal Makhani: Rich and creamy is just how they like to cook their food! A similar story as the top two dishes and equally tasty. 5. Naan: The only place I have eaten in Toronto where the Naan in round in shape similar to a Roti. It arrived fresh and tasted as if they just came out of the tandoor. They were very soft and was a perfect accompaniment to our dishes. Yes, we had a chicken overload and would probably need to spend extra hours at the gym the next day, but it was all worth it! Definitely recommended!!",2011-05-16,5.0,Waterdown,4,2,2
278,"I know little to nothing about Indian food.  I once mistook 'rogan josh' for Josh Rogan, someone how I assumed was related to Joe Rogan.  True story.  This being said, whatever type of Indian food Banjara has, authentic or not, I am buying.The naan is fresh and yum.  It is a nice mixture of chewy, toasty, and deliciousy.  The veggie pakora is well textured and perfectly deep fried.  Butter chicken is a must.  Many others have been consumed, but if you read my first line, you'd realize that I can't remember all these food names. Tip: save $1.50 by opting for regular naan over garlic naan.  The taste difference is minimal, especially after submerging it in the butter chicken.   The overly packed (but free) parking lot is a nice touch too.",2009-07-04,4.0,Toronto,4,1,2

The naan was good, the Karahi Beef wasnt quite what a ""karahi"" is traditionally meant to be, but was some sort of mild curry with overcooked green peppers and onions but was acceptable. The seekh kebab was horrible though! very hard and thick and rubbery, hard to break into pieces and dry, could almost ""bounce it off the wall"" as my mother put it. We told the server that the kebabs left much to be desired, and he was very nice about it and offered to make us a new batch or not charge for it.I'm probably not going to go here again, even though the other dishes might be better than what i ordered.",2009-06-15,2.0,New York,4,0,1
280,"I love bento boxes. I love the assortment of choices I have in one meal (don't worry, Banjara doesn't serve bento boxes). I like Banjara because they give you choice and offer dinner platters which are, what I consider them as, ""Indian bento boxes"". The times I've been there, it has always been full and busy. Waiting is never too long however, so don't fret. Besides, the smells will arouse your appetite even more so, so enough to allow your stomach to.. well.. stomach a whole dinner platter.I've talked about this platter enough, I think it's time to tell you why I liked it so much. It comes with rice AND Naan bread, a choice of Butter Chicken, Tikka Masala, goat curry, and a few other curry options. On the side there are Pakoras and rice pudding for dessert. All of this is served on a large metal plate. The portion and price are right on. Can't ask for too much more...I like how I was able to pair the entree with either rice or naan, which are both delicious. Extra sauce goes a long way when you like mopping it with the last piece of naan.I've tried a few other dishes here too, but I don't remember what exactly and how they tasted. Overall, Banjara has a lively atmosphere that is cozy but loud. It has good value for the portions but the food is pretty average. Nevertheless, I liked the platters, they give you a taste of everything you wanted to order on the menu anyways. It's a convenient package.

287,"Banjara is my favourite Indian restaurant this side of Little India. I generally try to eat vegetarian and there are lots of excellent veggy options on the menu here. Anything I've tried has been good but I'm particularly fond of Mater Paneer, Palak Paneer, and Chana Masala. All are rich, flavourful, and have just the right amount of spiciness. Despite costing almost twice as much as normal naan, I usually opt for one of the stuffed breads like Aloo Kulcha - It's definitely worth it. Also, the mango lassi is a must have.The only possible concern I can think of is that the food at Banjara is very rich, but this is to be expected from this type of cuisine, so I don't hold it against them. I have taken some people here who found the amount of oil and cream to be too much.

There are very few foods that I have the urge to smother over my body but this would be one of them. From the moment the spices burn through my nostrils to my tongue wrapping around a piece of chicken, the experience can be described as flawless. A perfect combination of creamy sweet tandoori and savoury bliss that makes my eyes roll back into my head. The old adjective saying ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" applies here as we always order the same thing. The chana masala and palak paneer are excellent choices and a perfect compliment to the the most excellent naan.In addition to the superb food, you can expect hardy size portions, decent prices and a friendly staff.  Accompanied by a lively atmosphere where everyone always appears to be enjoying themselves  helps complete the experience.On a concluding note, if you happen to think there is better butter chicken in TO, please locate the 'send message' link and enlighten me.

The Masala is different from other places I've eaten it at, especially because this dish felt more like a mix of a tandoori sizzler and tikka than it did the madras sauce style dishes I've had.the Chicken Tikka itself had huge pieces of chicken. You won't be hungry.Rice and naans were flavourful and the staff was excellent. Very helpful and kind and overall, a great experience. Great value for the money too.",2011-03-16,4.0,Toronto,1,0,1
315,"I definitely recommend this place.The first time I went, I ordered the Veggie Combo Dinner with Navratan Korma. They asked me what kind of spicy I want - mild, medium or really spicy - and in the spirit of being an Indian, I said to make it really spicy. But, there is a level of spiciness where a dish stops tasting good and starts merely tasting spicy, and unfortunately the korma crossed that level.However, the second time I visited the place, I ordered the same combo with Palak Paneer and asked for medium spicy, and it was perfect. I really enjoyed all the items in the combo. The portions were huge too, so that's a plus.So, ask for medium spicy and you will have a good time here.",2014-01-30,4.0,Toronto,1,0,0
316,"For the first time, about 6 years ago, my wife and I went to this location of Banjara and were simply blown away by the quality, affordability and the atmosphere of this place. Last week we decided to stop by for lunch and repeat the experience; this was a big mistake. My wife ordered a butter chicken+ a plain rice dish and I ordered a sizzling lamb kebab with butter naan, we also ordered one mango lassi and one salty lassi+a simple cucumber salad and one mango chutney.  The butter chicken was way below ordinary, how can you make butter chicken taste so bland and monotonous is beyond me, my ""sizzling"" kebab arrived on a cast iron dish but it wasn't sizzling at all , and it had a weird and unpleasant taste about it. The salty lassi had a very sour tone to it, almost as if they mistakenly added lemon juice to the drink or even worst, as if the yogurt had gone way passed its expiry. The mango chutney tasted like a sweetened cardboard and again had no flavour whatsoever. This experience cost us 55.00 CDN+ tip. There are many many places all around this city that offer the same dish with much higher quality for a similar price if not cheaper...I'm hoping this review will wake up some decision makers at the restaurant to make a better quality food...it's a real shame, I'm never going back.",2016-11-16,2.0,Toronto,0,0,0

It was Saturday night so we expected it to be busy, but we managed to grab a seat at the ""bar"" get a couple of Indians beers and wait until a table opened up. The 25 minute wait flew by as we munched on complimentary papadums and watched the guys in the guys in the kitchen work their magic. When we were finally seated the staff were courteous and attentive. Our meal took a bit longer then I would have liked but we were in no rush and as stated earlier the place was packed. The food arrived piping hot and absolutely delicious. The only problem we had was that our eyes were bigger then our stomachs!  Leftovers were taken home and demolished the next day for lunch.I have given this place a 4 instead of a 5 only because the kitchen lost our order and our food was took longer then I would have expected.

I wasn't quite sure why that extra 5 minutes was added but sure enough the order delivered in 1 hour and 5 minutes. While the wait for delivery is long, the food is worth it.

379,"Following rave reviews by our friends and checking the overly positive reviews on Yelp we chose this local North Indian eatery for dinner on a Friday night.  It is excellently located in downtown Toronto at Bloor and Christie and has ample off street parking.Arriving at 8 pm we (four of us) waited more than 40 minutes for a table.  Worth the wait we all agreed as the full and friendly room promised a lovely evening.Our evening was lovely but no thanks to the food or service.Service started out fine but when we all had our food on the table, distributed to our plates and no naan or roti on the table we had to get someone's attention to point out the oversight.  The room was very noisy so we had trouble getting anyone's attention but then bread was immediately provided.We ordered five dishes, 3 meats and two veggies.  The tandori chicken was dry and overdone, the butter chicken was sparse and not very creamy and the eggplant dish was a bowl of warrm mush with a vague sense of indian spices.  The aloo gobi was satisfactory (hard to screw that one up) and the rogan josh was not tender enough but ok.The bread (garlic naan) was too thin and too light in flavor for our taste.We had a lovely evening because of the warm atmosphere and excellent company but the meal itself did not satisfy and we thought was highly over rated.",2009-09-26,2.0,North York,1,0,1

Chicken Pakora, the batter was done really nicely, full of flavour.Garlic Rice (was good, but just okay).Chili Chicken which was impressive and I would recommend it.Lamb Korma was good, the sauce was good and lamb was moist.And of course, the Naan, we got butter and a Keema naan. The butter naan was so delicious, I would recommend just getting a few of those instead. There are some condiments on the table that you can use to top over bread or rice, but to be honest I am not sure what they were, one was a bit sweet and the other was like a yoghurt mint/spinach type thing. Both enjoyable. Not a huge beer selection on tap but we managed :)This place was packed on the Saturday night we went, and we were lucky to slip in without a reservation and not long of a wait (only 2 of us though).I will be going back to this place, I am excited to try more things and I am already craving their butter naan, so fluffy and satisfying.",2014-10-26,4.0,Toronto,0,0,0

394,"I was looking for a place for Indian buffet (I think it's a better deal that way so I can try many dishes at once) and came across Banjara on blogto's list of best Indian buffet and the positive reviews here on yelp. I have walked by the Christie Pit location several times and love the alluring aroma.So one Saturday my husband and I decided to give their buffet a try. However, we were disappointed to find that there is no buffet served at this location once we got there. It is apparently only available at the Eglinton location according to the staff that greeted us. I know on my part, I could have called to make sure, but I just trusted their website, which did not state that buffet was not available here. We still wanted Indian buffet and there was nothing else that interested us in the area so we took the TTC back down to Queen St and went to Little India (which was excellent and I highly recommend it). We were quite hungry and wanted something closer than trekking up to Eglinton. We are also too annoyed to trek up to Eglinton.So no buffet served here and they should correct their website information and save some people's inconvenience (and wasting their TTC tokens) by simply adding a few more words in there. I do still have faith in their food and believe they must have some pretty decent Indian food so to be fair, I will give them 3 star, which I think it's pretty generous considering how annoyed and hungry we were that day. If I ever try their buffet at the Eglinton location, I may upgrade the rating.",2011-09-24,3.0,Toronto,0,0,0

399,"This place would have received a much better rating from me if the service had been the least bit better.My partner and a friend ate here last night.  There were about 5-6 young girls working the floor, watching tables like hawks and making it feel all around uncomfortable.  They snatched up out plates and glasses the second we had finished and were not apologetic after forgetting my friends meal.  Instead they acted as if it was just coming later but it obviously wasn't as we had to ask about it. The food was good.  It was rich and flavourful, the naan was a good size as well as the rice dishes.  The lamb dish I has was tender and delicious, the butter chicken my partner had was good, the chunks of chicken were a little too big, and the paneer dish our friend had was delicious but tasted different from normal (she has had it many times before), maybe because they had forgot it and had to throw it together quickly.  What makes me give them a 2 star rating is at the end of the meal we were actually told to leave because there were tables waiting.  We had been there an hour and a half, not extraordinarily long, and there was a table of 4 2 tables over that had been there longer and were not asked to leave.  This is the best way to loose business and not get tipped.  Any good restaurant that wants return customers does not do this.  I will not be going back to dine here, maybe get take out.This place needs to train their staff and get real servers that respect customers and don't kick your customers out.",2012-10-24,2.0,Toronto,3,0,0

The service is another story altogether - it's below par and don't even get me started on their delivery standards. As an extremely regular customer both dining/ordering in, they could really use some training in the customer service department. Plastic bits found in food, meat in their veg dishes and late delivery times do not mean a thing to the staff - all you get is a shrug or some smug response. Oh btw one of their delivery guys questioned me regarding my tip and how he drove a bazillion kms to get to me on a cold cold night (5km to be exact and we're in Canada..the cold, really?!) I based it on the horrible service I received that night  what with staff in the background contemplating the distance and minimum delivery charges (which changes in accordance to who you get on the line).

403,"I am torn whether to give this restaurant two or three stars. The food was alright, but not up to the high standards of Toronto Indian fare. Granted, my meal was inexpensive and the portions were huge, but the taste was lacking. The woman who seated us was wonderful. If she was a host, I hope she will be promoted to a serving position. Our server, however, was terrible. She scoffed at my husband when he said he wanted his meal to be spicy. When his food came, it wasn't what he ordered. We didn't want to bring it up, partially because our server was moody and partially because we'd discussed trying something new anyway. After we received our food, our server continued to act like she detested our presence and didn't speak another word other than when she came to clear our plates. At that time, I asked for a to-go box. After I had cleared my leftovers into the box, our server took all the plates except for my husband's (because he was clearing his food into the to-go box as well) and then stood, watching my husband, with a scowl on her face until he was done. When she brought our cheque, again, she said absolutely nothing. Finally, she glared at me, without saying a word, the entire time my card was running. We're polite customers and since I've spent a lot of time working in the service industry, I'm well aware what it is like to be a server and how customers should act. That said, I'm wholly confident that we did nothing to provoke our server to act like we took a wiz on her parade. The whole experience was weird. It seemed like the other servers were much nicer and I wonder if we just came on an off night for the food. Regardless, I doubt we'll be back, since there are too many other options in this city to justify giving someplace sub-par a second chance.",2013-01-17,2.0,Toronto,0,0,0

405,"WOW! This place was REALLY GOOD!!!I've passed by this spot a million times going in/out/through Koreatown and while it's been many things over the years, I believe Banjara has been in this spot for some time now and is probably there to stay. I was in the mood for some good Indian and my only experience with the place was at some send-off party for a colleague a while back where some of the food was catered by Banjara, though I could not say what was and what wasn't. We were trying to figure out where to take our mama to eat when my brother suggested we try Banjara as he'd heard that their butter chicken was good. I had to Yelp it to see what others were saying and it seemed to be a go, so off we went (the time of day was also a factor since it was rush-hour). The first good sign was that the parking lot was full (not a problem at all, just park on Crawford, its cross-street). There is a lot of seating on their patio, though I did not care to sit outside in the humidity. I was actually expecting a dumpy place with good food, but when you step into the patio area to enter the restaurant, the setup/condition isn't bad at all. I was pleasantly surprised; it wasn't dingy and the staff were all really nice and friendly--which, those factors + good food are really what matter more than fancy decor and a pretentious crowd anyway. The crowd was a mixed bag and the place started to fill up pretty quickly once 6pm rolled around. There was also constant foot traffic of those doing take-out and I can totally see why. The smells emanating from the kitchen were quite noticeable but in a good way. I was ready to eat after a few sniffs of what promised to be nothing but goodness.As our mom is still new to Indian food, we ordered the safe items while munching on the papadums they lay on our table. The dishes we ordered are ones that can more or less be found among the many possibilities at the standard Indian buffet:- butter chicken: very tasty, just the right balance of spice and creaminess; contained juicy pieces of tandoori chicken- paneer: the soft chunks of cheese were dee-lish and the sauce dense with spinach- chicken biryani: wonderfully spiced with chunks of dark meat- beef vindaloo: my bro commented that it would probably be better with lamb or goat (neither of which am I a fan) which is probably quite true. We opted for the third degree of their four-pepper scale and it was actually extremely mild. We like our spice but weren't sure what the others could handle though we thought 3 / 4 would still be living on the edge. It wasn't, and it was just 'alright': soft pieces of stewed brisket meat was plentiful though...- (plain) naan: REALLY GOOD, fluffy and full of flavour, though the very bottom piece was a little oilier than I like as it seemed to be soaking up the grease from the top layers but hey, a little grease is forgiveable! I liked that it didn't turn into floorboard once it cooled, the way it does at some places--maybe the stiffness-when-cooled trait comes from sloppily overcrisping (ie, burning) it?- mango lassi: I've never had such a thick mango lassi and it was more mango than anything else which is NOT a complaint. It was the perfect accompaniment to a hot day and full of mango flavour. I liked that it was more mango than yoghurt!!* my mom had also ordered a soup to start which she enjoyed. It appeared to be a scalding hot bowl with a tomato-y base with some mild curry and some chunks of veggies--I could make out tomato, sugar snap peas, and carrots. I should have tried some but it was too hot of a day for soup.Of all the dishes, I'd say the vindaloo was our least fave although it was still decent. Were it not for the coriander, I doubt the mild-ness would have carried this dish on its own but I guess that's what we get for ordering 3 chili-level heat. Lesson learned.The only real drawback was the washroom, which was pretty gross. Someone had left a mass of something or other in the women's toilet so that it could not be used or flushed, let alone stepping foot in there. If the washrooms were decent, I think that 5th star would have been earned but anyhow if you can hold it in 'til you get home, this place is definitely worth a visit if you've got a hankering for some good Indian food!!I can't say anything about the prices of individual dishes since I never looked at the menu but it was mentioned that the prices are typical for Indian food. I think our total was something like $70 (no alcohol; pre-tax and tip) and we all left pretty full. We tried to walk some of it off in the park but settled on some benches instead. For whatever reason, I thought Banjara might be a tad cheaper than other Indian restos but anyway, it's totally worth it. If you know you're getting decent food, you should expect to cough up at least what the others are charging.",2011-08-09,4.0,Toronto,4,0,2

Naan is warm and tender and comes with your meal, which is nice. The service can be excellent to absolutely shoddy though.
